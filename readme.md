#ui-navigation-drawer

In the early days of modern mobile computing, there were challenges to present users with a set of menus with limited screen space. With mobile apps growing in complexity, mobile app developers begin to wonder how they can add more menus to the app, with shallow learning curve that will aid users in providing extended navigation while keeping the user experience pleasant when using the app. Comes the navigation drawer, originally custom-implemented in Facebook app, more mobile apps are drawing increasingly closer in incorporating the navigation drawer in their apps.

Nowadays, it's very common to see the navigation drawer in mobile apps and Google even decided to incorporate the navigation drawer in the standard Android SDK. This is the navigation pattern that most developers will want to use in their app, so, Crosslight has created a support in using the navigation drawer for Android and iOS apps. Crosslight provides several samples that incorprorates the navigation drawer pattern to help developers integrate the navigation drawer into their Crosslight-powered apps easily.
